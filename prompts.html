  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p class="sidebar">The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the economy, routines and pace of everyday life across the world. This project asks you to consider the poetics of your home and how its physical and emotional character is changing during this time. The home, whatever that may be for someone, is a space we each know intimately and can therefore represent poetically by sharing our memories, frustrations, daydreams, and also by by describing its physical configuration.
  </p>

  <p class="sidebar">
    This is a project of <a href="https://www.castroluna.com/">Claudia Castro Luna</a>, Washington State Poet Laureate (2018-2021), in collaboration with <a href="http://gwoolston.me/">Gregory Woolston</a> and <a href="http://amritamaz.net/">Amrita Mazumdar</a>. The Poet Laureate program is presented by <a href="https://www.humanities.org/">Humanities Washington</a> and <a href="https://www.arts.wa.gov/">ArtsWA</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Territory Acknowledgement</h2>
  <p class="sidebar">We acknowledge that this project is placed over the ancestral territories of multiple Indigenous peoples who lived, prospered and continue to thrive on land that is now Washington State. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Native Land Digital</a>, the UW's <a href="https://ais.washington.edu/">Department of American Indian Studies</a>, and <a href="http://www.experiencewa.com/articles/discover-washingtons-american-indian-heritage-sites-and-museums">Experience Washington</a>. </p>

        <h2>Prompts</h2>
      <p class="par">
        Any poems of home are encouraged, but here are some ideas to get you started:
      </p>

      <p class="par">
        <i>
        <ul>
          <li>As we continue to shelter-in-place, what spaces in your home are most important to you? How has your living space changed for this time? Are you working out of a bedroom or kitchen, or sleeping in your living room?
      </li>
          <li>How have technologies like FaceTime, Skype, and Zoom transformed your home? Who is visiting virtually and what are they allowed to see? In what ways have the spaces of your home become connected to those of others?
      </li>
          <li>What spaces or objects in your home hold special memories for you? How might they transport you to other places or other imaginings?
      </li>
        </ul>
        </i>
      </p>

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p class="par">
        May Sarton provides one example of a poem about home below, and the Academy of American Poets has also compiled a list of <a href="https://poets.org/text/poems-about-home">Poems about the Home</a>.

      <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p><b>A Light Left On</b><br>
      <i>May Sarton</i></p>
      <p>
        In the evening we came back<br>
        Into our yellow room,<br>
        For a moment taken aback<br>
        To find the light left on,<br>
        Falling on silent flowers,<br>
        Table, book, empty chair<br>
        While we had gone elsewhere,<br>
        Had been away for hours.<br><br>

        When we came home together<br>
        We found the inside weather.<br>
        All of our love unended<br>
        The quiet light demanded,<br>
        And we gave, in a look<br>
        At yellow walls and open book.<br>
        The deepest world we share<br>
        And do not talk about<br>
        But have to have, was there,<br>
        And by that light found out.<br>
      </p>

        <h2>Submissions</h2>
      <p class="par">
        Any poems, observations, mini-essays of home are encouraged. A simple image, a counter, window, shoe rack, emblematic of the writing would greatly enhance this effort at documenting our selves and our home spaces during this time. Please submit your writing, as well as your name, location, and if possible, some media of the space (picture, video, or audio) to Claudia Castro Luna at <a href="mailto:poeticshelters@gmail.com">poeticshelters@gmail.com</a>.
