  poem: Home structured in place<br>
        words from books with golden leaves<br>
        coverage of stories bless me<br>
        singly sitting in my cabin of flight<br>
        where I land, many galaxies at night<br>
        coverage of imagination blesses me<br>
        gardens of tenderness<br>
        green shoots with compost, the everlasting church of the garden<br>
        coverage of fresh growth blesses me<br>
        red flannel bedding cleanly washed<br>
        a glorious featherbed waiting to hold my body<br>
        coverage of nighttime dreams bless me<br>
        I am the boat in the water of my bathtub<br>
        a temple of sea-salts soaking<br>
        coverage of wellness blesses me<br>
        cooking in the kitchen<br>
        transformation served up on plates<br>
        coverage of nourishment blesses me<br>
        the gilded shelter unlocked<br>
        paying attention to my soul<br>
        coverage of “its nice to meet me,” blesses me.

  poem: What is happening to our hearts?<br><br>
        In our hearts?<br><br>
        We wake in the night to think of our loved ones.<br>
        We feel the enormity of our love  for each of our dearest.<br>
        We call. We forget what had appeared broken.<br>
        So too even unto ourselves.<br>
        Love reigns as she opens our eyes to the beauty in each of our beloveds.<br>
        And in ourselves.<br>
        As we know, when we encounter those we don’t even know, what we share:<br>
        A longing to touch. To connect.<br>
        Moments of thanks, and preparation, should we need it, for goodbyes.<br>
        As we slow, to enjoy preparing and eating.<br>
        As we plant, in our victory gardens,<br>
        little rows of hope.<br>
        As we see young fathers walking with their children.<br>
        At last.<br>
        How long we have waited to rediscover the simple.<br>
        To come home.<br>
        Seeing our homes and having time to dig deep into dusty corners,<br>
        To clean and polish,<br>
        Touch our homes with affection,<br>
        Until they gleam.
