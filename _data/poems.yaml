            Living in Sin

  poem: She had thought the studio would keep itself;<br>
        no dust upon the furniture of love.<br>
        Half heresy, to wish the taps less vocal,<br>
        the panes relieved of grime. A plate of pears,<br>
        a piano with a Persian shawl, a cat<br>
        stalking the picturesque amusing mouse<br>
        had risen at his urging.<br>
        Not that at five each separate stair would writhe<br>
        under the milkman's tramp; that morning light<br>
        so coldly would delineate the scraps<br>
        of last night's cheese and three sepulchral bottles;<br>
        that on the kitchen shelf among the saucers<br>
        a pair of beetle-eyes would fix her own---<br>
        envoy from some village in the moldings . . .<br>
        Meanwhile, he, with a yawn,<br>
        sounded a dozen notes upon the keyboard,<br>
        declared it out of tune, shrugged at the mirror,<br>
        rubbed at his beard, went out for cigarettes;<br>
        while she, jeered by the minor demons,<br>
        pulled back the sheets and made the bed and found<br>
        a towel to dust the table-top,<br>
        and let the coffee-pot boil over on the stove.<br>
        By evening she was back in love again,<br>
        though not so wholly but throughout the night<br>
        she woke sometimes to feel the daylight coming<br>
        like a relentless milkman up the stairs.

            The Cabbage

  poem: You have rented an apartment.<br>
        You come to this enclosure with physical relief,<br>
        your heavy body climbing the stairs in the dark,<br>
        the hall bulb burned out, the landlord<br>
        of Greek extraction and possibly a fatalist.<br>
        In the apartment leaning against one wall,<br>
        your daughter's painting of a large frilled cabbage<br>
        against a dark sky with pinpoints of stars.<br>
        The eager vegetable, opening itself<br>
        as if to eat the air, or speak in cabbage<br>
        language of the meanings within meanings;<br>
        while the points of stars hide their massive<br>
        violence in the dark upper half of the painting.<br>
        You can live with this.

  poem: In the evening we came back<br>
        Into our yellow room,<br>
        For a moment taken aback<br>
        To find the light left on,<br>
        Falling on silent flowers,<br>
        Table, book, empty chair<br>
        While we had gone elsewhere,<br>
        Had been away for hours.<br><br>
        When we came home together<br>
        We found the inside weather.<br>
        All of our love unended<br>
        The quiet light demanded,<br>
        And we gave, in a look<br>
        At yellow walls and open book.<br>
        The deepest world we share<br>
        and do not talk about<br>
        But have to have, was there,<br>
        And by that light found out.
