  poem: Home structured in place<br>
        words from books with golden leaves<br>
        coverage of stories bless me<br>
        singly sitting in my cabin of flight<br>
        where I land, many galaxies at night<br>
        coverage of imagination blesses me<br>
        gardens of tenderness<br>
        green shoots with compost, the everlasting church of the garden<br>
        coverage of fresh growth blesses me<br>
        red flannel bedding cleanly washed<br>
        a glorious featherbed waiting to hold my body<br>
        coverage of nighttime dreams bless me<br>
        I am the boat in the water of my bathtub<br>
        a temple of sea-salts soaking<br>
        coverage of wellness blesses me<br>
        cooking in the kitchen<br>
        transformation served up on plates<br>
        coverage of nourishment blesses me<br>
        the gilded shelter unlocked<br>
        paying attention to my soul<br>
        coverage of “its nice to meet me,” blesses me.

  poem: Apple trees stripped<br>
        of their summer fruit<br>
        squat like ancient mothers<br>
        fingering the intricate lacework<br>
        of their own moon shadows<br><br>
        and we<br>
        slipping into their solemn world<br>
        feel the evening’s strident headlines<br>
        grow silent<br>
        as the peace of this place<br>
        of this moment<br>
        sifts down into us<br>
        drifts into its own elaborate design<br>
        weaves deep within us<br>
        its own magical pattern<br><br>
        to carry us through<br>
        the days ahead

  poem: Where would you go<br>
        If nothing could bind you?<br>
        A flicker whispers in my ear.<br>
        I listen to the rain<br>
        Falling,<br>
        &nbsp; 	&nbsp; 	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; falling,<br>
        &nbsp; 	&nbsp; 	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; 	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; falling<br>
        It takes me to where I want to be<br>
        outside these four walls.<br>
        I become a tree.<br>
        Standing still in place<br>
        Branches up, reaching out<br>
        Trunk, and leaves growing<br>
        Touching the clouds<br>
        Standing in place, not moving.<br>
        And yet,<br>
        Sheltering all kinds of life in body<br>
        Hugging the earth with my roots<br>
        In this confinement,<br>
        I find the path;<br>
        I am alive<br>
        A witness to these trying times<br>
        and all is good<br>
        Inside.

  poem: In the first week<br>
        I was full of plans:<br>
        Language, songs to learn<br>
        bread to bake<br>
        murals to paint.<br>
        Long-neglected house projects,<br>
        suddenly front and center,<br>
        standing tall. Proud to be<br>
        of service.<br><br>
        I would use our collective<br>
        solitude, too,<br>
        to rethink the balance of<br>
        the world<br>
        and my place in it.<br><br>
        Now, eight weeks in,<br>
        I stand transfixed:<br>
        watching a hummingbird<br>
        hover and strike in the air<br>
        devouring insects<br>
        a flash of ruby red<br>
        at her throat.<br><br>
        Sorrow<br>
        at times<br>
        has left me unable to rise<br>
        from my chair.<br>
        But the dog comes and shoves<br>
        her muzzle into<br>
        my curled fingers.<br><br>
        My children sleep and grow, sleep<br>
        and grow<br>
        and the sky is bluer<br>
        than it has ever been.<br><br>

  poem: What is happening to our hearts?<br><br>
        In our hearts?<br><br>
        We wake in the night to think of our loved ones.<br>
        We feel the enormity of our love  for each of our dearest.<br>
        We call. We forget what had appeared broken.<br>
        So too even unto ourselves.<br>
        Love reigns as she opens our eyes to the beauty in each of our beloveds.<br>
        And in ourselves.<br>
        As we know, when we encounter those we don’t even know, what we share:<br>
        A longing to touch. To connect.<br>
        Moments of thanks, and preparation, should we need it, for goodbyes.<br>
        As we slow, to enjoy preparing and eating.<br>
        As we plant, in our victory gardens,<br>
        little rows of hope.<br>
        As we see young fathers walking with their children.<br>
        At last.<br>
        How long we have waited to rediscover the simple.<br>
        To come home.<br>
        Seeing our homes and having time to dig deep into dusty corners,<br>
        To clean and polish,<br>
        Touch our homes with affection,<br>
        Until they gleam.

  poem: Perhaps I’ve marked each passing day in isolation<br>
        a pencil hashmark on a window sill.<br>
        Perhaps I’ve paced a line inside the chain-link fence<br>
        until the path is worn bald.<br>
        Perhaps I’ve fixed a meal of<br>
        potatoes again.<br>
        The hashmarks join the arrows<br>
        marking the sun at sunset<br>
        each solstice, each equinox.<br>
        The fence protects against the tumbleweeds<br>
        from the neighboring lot.<br>
        Maybe these changes are  recent, I don’t recall<br>
        but I’ve long been known<br>
        to love potatoes.

            Cutting Each Other’s Hair During the Corona Virus

  poem: We are two women who got married<br>
        seven years ago<br>
        but that is not our story of courage.<br>
        This story is about<br>
        sitting in the yard<br>
        in a plastic chair<br>
        an old towel around my shoulders,<br>
        clippers, scissors with teeth<br>
        on a side table<br>
        and my wife<br>
        with an anxious face<br>
        coming toward me<br>
        with sharp, small scissors.<br><br>
        If you think<br>
        we have no training for this job,<br>
        you are wrong.<br>
        We watched an old guy<br>
        with thinning hair<br>
        cut his own<br>
        on U Tube.<br><br>
        But now,<br>
        my wife lifts the clippers<br>
        to the back of my neck.<br>
        The goldfinches in the apple tree,<br>
        dapper in their bold spring plumage,<br>
        chirp encouragement.<br>
        Our dog watches<br>
        from the sidelines,<br>
        face filled with alarm.<br><br>
        The clippers buzz their way<br>
        along my neck,<br>
        then she grabs handfuls of hair<br>
        on top and lets the toothy scissors<br>
        munch on each clump.<br><br>
        When we switch, I let the clippers<br>
        linger and a bald spot<br>
        glares on the back of her head.<br><br>
        After,<br>
        when we look in the mirror<br>
        my formerly fluffy hair<br>
        is flat and the back of your head<br>
        is too close to bald,<br>
        but we glitter<br>
        smiles to each other<br>
        as if we just renewed our vows.

            Some Things I Really Like Right Now

  poem: "Guzzling cold water out of a bucket from the hand pump well.<br><br>
        Getting up in the morning and feeling the heat off the cook stove on my forehead.<br><br>
        Sipping the first two cups of coffee off the stove.<br><br>
        Walking around the house with the dog pack, smelling<br>
        Douglas fir smoke wreathing from the chimney.<br><br>
        Standing barefoot in our creek.<br><br>
        Smelling sagebrush crushed in my hands.<br><br>
        Smelling a burning smudge of sagebrush wafting through the house.<br><br>
        Watching clouds form up like spirits returning to the canyon above the house.<br><br>
        Listening to the whisper and sough of the fluttering aspen next to the window.<br><br>
        Following Chong’s suntanned legs up our creek.<br><br>
        Watching Chong nap on our hot granite bed in the afternoon.<br><br>
        Starting a new poem, finishing it, recrafting it again.<br><br>
        Sitting on a rock with a notebook and beginning a new sketch.<br><br>
        Enjoying that moment when the sketch says: “You’re finished.”<br><br>
        Sleeping in the grass with Wolfie and Luna the German Shepherds, and Dong-ee the Rottweiler.<br><br><br><br>
        Corresponding with Mike Robinson, creating new poems, learning from him as mentor and counselor, friend.<br><br>
        Laying out Okanogan Poems volume 4 on OneDrive with intrepid fellow steward and old friend, Okanogan poet, Walter Henze.<br><br>
        Emailing George and Patti Baumgardner about life, poetry, Earth, and the stars.<br><br>
        Talking with David, Hanna, and Sarah Kliegman about landscape restoration, homesteading, cooking, and trail and park making.<br><br>
        Emailing to Victoria Jones, Bob Goodwin, Carey Hunter, Walter Henze, George and Patti Baumgardner, Todd Thorn, Mary Koch, Dan Hulphers and Bobbie Hackett about their poems, about life and the real things that happen on the land.<br><br>
        Relearning the Español with my faithful neighbors and friends, Celso Pacheco-Pascacio and Carolina Ramos.<br><br>
        Eating never-the-same, so-called-routine breakfasts and dinners that Chong makes day after day.<br><br>
        Listening to Eagles concerts on YouTube with Chong.<br><br>
        These are some of the things I like right now."

        Since its Thursday, put on gloves, mask, take car for its weekly drive. Don’t think about the olden days, when drives to restaurants or movies were every day easy.<br><br>
        Buy new hair trimmer; I’m sure it was the trimmer’s fault that J’s hair turned out that way.<br><br>
        Find flour. Buy some on Etsy? Email K for bread recipe. Search for Mother’s recipe. The scent of baking bread evokes stability, safety, security.<br><br>

        Lived and loved and embraced<br>
        and yelled and screamed in delight.<br>
        As well as anger with this family<br>
        for fifty odd years.<br><br>
        Kitchen redolent with smells divine.<br>
        Pungent, garlicky with pork,<br>

        Spaces of men and gods,<br>
        promises of life;<br>
        of sky and stone<br>
        and earth warmed by sun<br>
        sheltered by those cedars<br>
        planted by the boys in childhood.<br>
        Bamboo and hedges of unknown<br>
        Provenance.<br>
        Caressed by life of azaleas petunias, banana,<br>
        tomato, squash, peppers, even lemon trees nurtured in pots<br>
        through challenging winters of sleet and snow.<br><br>
        In this space,<br>
        Squirrels daily race the dog to safety<br>
        In the cedar, knowing she never wins but<br>
        granting the thrill of chase to<br>
        breathe life to her dreams.<br>
        Jays and crows scold demanding food or something.<br>
        Robins and tiny sparrows<br>
        Break the night stillness<br>
        with sounds of enduring life, for that is the<br>
        order of things in the outdoor spaces.<br><br>
        Summertime sharing<br>
        rice and chicken and pork and shrimp<br>
        and Persian saffron, crimson with promise of sex and life.<br>
        Transformed into Spanish paella<br>
        fashioned with a hint of Ilocano and Ktunaxa<br>
        For good ethnic balance in this<br>
        household of voices singing<br>
        Family and family and family.<br><br>
        The walls -hung with paintings<br>
        Of children, women, flowers<br>
        Creations seeking<br>
        Eternal glimpses of<br>
        unbearable beauty<br>
        and life-<br>
        struggle vainly<br>
        to contain joy and<br>
        pain, love and passion within.<br><br>
        The weeping of agony and loss<br>
        Overcome always by the soft, smooth warmth<br>
        of your being, coaxing greater<br>
        Cries of passion and love<br>
        Escaping confines of this house.<br><br>
        The pandemic?<br>
        a small but significant footnote<br>
        forcing time to breathe, sleep, contemplate.<br>
        Long from now we will tell<br>
        Of the time of great fear,<br>
        Overwhelmed by the Greater Joy.

        Like the coyotes in the canyon…<br>
        That money won’t free us<br>

        And every living thing it’s made from.

            Thunderbird's Garden
  author: Harvey Schwartz

  filter: nw
  poem: Thunderbird flaps his wings as I prune near the pond, lost in thought. Aviary drumbeat awakens me from arboreal slumber as I rise.<br><br>
        I’ve learned to trust oneness with pond and garden, so I float on lilac scents, drift to the beat of wings.<br><br>
        It’s not what I’d think or any plans that I’ve made.<br><br>
        I brush tips of evergreens as I float to cirrus clouds. White mountains below are shockingly bright. Himalayas beckon me as stars burn holes through black sky with crackling distraction.<br><br>
        I drift until I wonder why I’m wet, see I’m on a skiff blown by hurricane winds. I really don’t care.<br><br>
        A turquoise eddy ahead becomes a whirlpool I cannot avoid. I gush downward to a bright blue jar that overflows with mammoth rainbow-hued marbles lying along ocean's bottom. They roll out of sight in turbid graywater. Swishing sounds and swirling colors surround me.<br><br>
        Water rages with thunderous force but I casually mount a surfboard, glide toward the round smoothness of more mega marbles. Crash into them but am surprised by softness, slip back to whooshing water madness. Struggling, I swallow what surprises me by tasting of apple.<br><br>
        I am flummoxed by familiarity. Certainty is sudden. Marbles are continents.<br><br>
        I pop put from the sea to a tall masted ship, one of three close to an empty shore. The first mate speaks a familiar but foreign tongue. I have a crew to command and must be decisive.<br><br>
        We drop anchor, I handpick the best, leave trusted ones to care for the ship. Have no hope to return. We row away from the bay, nearby trees twice as big as I’ve known.<br><br>
        We row until well-worn hands have hard-earned blisters. We row until land is a dream, all that I knew a memory. I join the wind.<br><br>
        I rise on the back of Thunderbird and float through wispy white clouds. Hypnotic wings flap me awake. I know he is right and continue to prune.

        I would flee the honey-dooz—<br>
        the paint flaking from the trim,<br>
        the loose boards on the fence<br>
        waiting to be nailed,<br>
        the invasive species that has<br>
        taken root in my backyard,<br>
        the hedge in need<br>
        of a haircut as badly as me.<br>
        Now I'm a piece of furniture<br>
        trapped in my own house,<br>
        as wooden as the desk<br>
        at which I sit writing these words.<br>
        I may write a poem<br>
        called My Life as a Chair<br>
        because I am learning the feeling<br>
        of simply occupying space,<br>
        gazing out the window<br>
        at the same patch of grass<br>
        waiting to be mowed,<br>
        the same flowerbed<br>
        wanting to be weeded.<br><br>
        My wife and I hardly speak.<br>
        We're not mad at each other,<br>
        just numb, as though we've<br>
        been hit with a zombie stick.<br>
        She sits in the living room<br>
        and listens to audio books.<br>
        I sit in my study<br>
        and scan the headlines<br>
        on my laptop news feed<br>
        for signs of relief.<br>
        But all is bombast—<br>
        a fat face like Jabba the Hutt<br>
        telling me I'm old, expendable,<br>
        that facts are fake news,<br>
        that snake oil cures all<br>
        and nothing's as bad as it seems.<br>
        It's an alternate reality<br>
        like an alternate fact<br>
        we imagine until it becomes true.<br>
        The people walking past<br>
        on my street look lost.<br>
        We're all pinching ourselves.<br>
        We want to wake up.

  poem: A place to relax<br>
        Now it is a place of work<br>
        How can I go back?

  poem: These months without our teams, we convert<br>
        a dose of sport-spectator energy<br>
        to the closer study of our feeders hung<br>
        for kitchen-window viewing. We predict<br>
        a Pacific wren, a western tanager, a waxwing.<br>
        Someone a little flashy or rare. With a crest<br>
        or dazzling yellow plumage. Always the crow<br>
        will be captain, the Steller’s jay and starling, the crew.<br>
        A robin who tugged off a strip of birch bark, presumably for his nest,<br>
        almost won, and I love the Calypte annas, but they aren’t in contention<br>
        since the salvia's out along the side path,<br>
        hidden from us while we eat.<br><br>
        How to explain my choice<br>
        when it is not the brightest who wins my affection?<br>
        Not the life-list novelty? Not a record-setter?<br>
        How, from the rear, emerged an unexpected hero,<br>
        an unassuming little gray-brown body,<br>
        black-headed, with a surprise of white<br>
        in its tail at departure?<br><br>
        It chips at the seed cake I made.<br>
        It pecks in our clover yard.<br>
        It hops up the front walk as if to join us inside for tea.<br>
        It likes what we set out for it in wire baskets,<br>
        and flies in and out of our lives repeatedly<br>
        each day if we’re lucky. A wild thing<br>
        for us to see.

            Sophomore Year in the Midst of a Pandemic

  poem: I had to move out of the college dorms. Stripped away from my friends,<br>
        Away from the coffee shops,<br>
        Away from the classrooms,<br>
        Away from the study spots,<br>
        Away from the house parties,<br>
        Away from all social interaction.<br>
        These are supposed to be the prime time in our lives. To do stupid stuff, to be young.<br><br>
        I am now in my childhood bedroom.<br>
        With the old paint and posters on the wall.<br>
        Surrounded by things that remind me that I am no longer an adult again.<br>
        In the beginning, it took a while for me to adjust that I didn’t have my freedom anymore. Living<br>
        in the heart of Seattle and now living in the suburbs somewhere in Washington. The springtime<br>
        on campus is so beautiful.<br>
        People smiling,<br>
        People living,<br>
        Thriving.<br><br>
        But this is the new reality. We are living in a pandemic.<br>
        Studying through a pandemic.<br>
        Studying in my childhood bedroom instead of the artsy coffee shop with my close friends.<br><br>
        I miss it, I do.<br>
        But I understand that nobody could’ve predicted this,<br>
        That we just need to do our part to stay at home,<br>
        To go back to doing the things we really miss.
