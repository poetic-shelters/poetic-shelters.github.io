  poem: Home structured in place<br>
        words from books with golden leaves<br>
        coverage of stories bless me<br>
        singly sitting in my cabin of flight<br>
        where I land, many galaxies at night<br>
        coverage of imagination blesses me<br>
        gardens of tenderness<br>
        green shoots with compost, the everlasting church of the garden<br>
        coverage of fresh growth blesses me<br>
        red flannel bedding cleanly washed<br>
        a glorious featherbed waiting to hold my body<br>
        coverage of nighttime dreams bless me<br>
        I am the boat in the water of my bathtub<br>
        a temple of sea-salts soaking<br>
        coverage of wellness blesses me<br>
        cooking in the kitchen<br>
        transformation served up on plates<br>
        coverage of nourishment blesses me<br>
        the gilded shelter unlocked<br>
        paying attention to my soul<br>
        coverage of “its nice to meet me,” blesses me.

  poem: sit vacant in the gray<br>
        light of morning,<br>
        reminders of where<br>
        we sat yesterday,<br>
        our first visit in months.<br><br>
        This virus, armed with wedges<br>
        places an ironic twist on the adage<br>
        <i>Divided We Fall.<br>
        Now it’s Divided We Live,<br></i>
        so, no hugs<br><br>
        when we spotted you<br>
        on the street, despite<br>
        desire so strong it hurt.<br>
        Instead, laughs, tears<br>
        and the feeling I sit with<br><br>
        today, writing this poem:<br>
        a knowing that if we don’t survive,<br>
        instead become statistics,<br>
        that you loved us<br>
        as deeply as we loved you;<br><br>
        that these chairs outside,<br>
        weathering spring sun, rain and hail<br>
        are not vacant at all–  despite<br>
        all appearances, they cradle<br>
        invisible treasures<br><br>
        of cherished lives.

  poem: What is happening to our hearts?<br><br>
        In our hearts?<br><br>
        We wake in the night to think of our loved ones.<br>
        We feel the enormity of our love  for each of our dearest.<br>
        We call. We forget what had appeared broken.<br>
        So too even unto ourselves.<br>
        Love reigns as she opens our eyes to the beauty in each of our beloveds.<br>
        And in ourselves.<br>
        As we know, when we encounter those we don’t even know, what we share:<br>
        A longing to touch. To connect.<br>
        Moments of thanks, and preparation, should we need it, for goodbyes.<br>
        As we slow, to enjoy preparing and eating.<br>
        As we plant, in our victory gardens,<br>
        little rows of hope.<br>
        As we see young fathers walking with their children.<br>
        At last.<br>
        How long we have waited to rediscover the simple.<br>
        To come home.<br>
        Seeing our homes and having time to dig deep into dusty corners,<br>
        To clean and polish,<br>
        Touch our homes with affection,<br>
        Until they gleam.

  poem: In the first week<br>
        I was full of plans:<br>
        Language, songs to learn<br>
        bread to bake<br>
        murals to paint.<br>
        Long-neglected house projects,<br>
        suddenly front and center,<br>
        standing tall. Proud to be<br>
        of service.<br><br>
        I would use our collective<br>
        solitude, too,<br>
        to rethink the balance of<br>
        the world<br>
        and my place in it.<br><br>
        Now, eight weeks in,<br>
        I stand transfixed:<br>
        watching a hummingbird<br>
        hover and strike in the air<br>
        devouring insects<br>
        a flash of ruby red<br>
        at her throat.<br><br>
        Sorrow<br>
        at times<br>
        has left me unable to rise<br>
        from my chair.<br>
        But the dog comes and shoves<br>
        her muzzle into<br>
        my curled fingers.<br><br>
        My children sleep and grow, sleep<br>
        and grow<br>
        and the sky is bluer<br>
        than it has ever been.<br><br>
