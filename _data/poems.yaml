  poem: Home structured in place<br>
        words from books with golden leaves<br>
        coverage of stories bless me<br>
        singly sitting in my cabin of flight<br>
        where I land, many galaxies at night<br>
        coverage of imagination blesses me<br>
        gardens of tenderness<br>
        green shoots with compost, the everlasting church of the garden<br>
        coverage of fresh growth blesses me<br>
        red flannel bedding cleanly washed<br>
        a glorious featherbed waiting to hold my body<br>
        coverage of nighttime dreams bless me<br>
        I am the boat in the water of my bathtub<br>
        a temple of sea-salts soaking<br>
        coverage of wellness blesses me<br>
        cooking in the kitchen<br>
        transformation served up on plates<br>
        coverage of nourishment blesses me<br>
        the gilded shelter unlocked<br>
        paying attention to my soul<br>
        coverage of “its nice to meet me,” blesses me.

  poem: Apple trees stripped<br>
        of their summer fruit<br>
        squat like ancient mothers<br>
        fingering the intricate lacework<br>
        of their own moon shadows<br><br>
        and we<br>
        slipping into their solemn world<br>
        feel the evening’s strident headlines<br>
        grow silent<br>
        as the peace of this place<br>
        of this moment<br>
        sifts down into us<br>
        drifts into its own elaborate design<br>
        weaves deep within us<br>
        its own magical pattern<br><br>
        to carry us through<br>
        the days ahead

  poem: Where would you go<br>
        If nothing could bind you?<br>
        A flicker whispers in my ear.<br>
        I listen to the rain<br>
        Falling,<br>
        &nbsp; 	&nbsp; 	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; falling,<br>
        &nbsp; 	&nbsp; 	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; 	&nbsp; 	&nbsp;	&nbsp;	&nbsp; 	&nbsp; falling<br>
        It takes me to where I want to be<br>
        outside these four walls.<br>
        I become a tree.<br>
        Standing still in place<br>
        Branches up, reaching out<br>
        Trunk, and leaves growing<br>
        Touching the clouds<br>
        Standing in place, not moving.<br>
        And yet,<br>
        Sheltering all kinds of life in body<br>
        Hugging the earth with my roots<br>
        In this confinement,<br>
        I find the path;<br>
        I am alive<br>
        A witness to these trying times<br>
        and all is good<br>
        Inside.

  poem: In the first week<br>
        I was full of plans:<br>
        Language, songs to learn<br>
        bread to bake<br>
        murals to paint.<br>
        Long-neglected house projects,<br>
        suddenly front and center,<br>
        standing tall. Proud to be<br>
        of service.<br><br>
        I would use our collective<br>
        solitude, too,<br>
        to rethink the balance of<br>
        the world<br>
        and my place in it.<br><br>
        Now, eight weeks in,<br>
        I stand transfixed:<br>
        watching a hummingbird<br>
        hover and strike in the air<br>
        devouring insects<br>
        a flash of ruby red<br>
        at her throat.<br><br>
        Sorrow<br>
        at times<br>
        has left me unable to rise<br>
        from my chair.<br>
        But the dog comes and shoves<br>
        her muzzle into<br>
        my curled fingers.<br><br>
        My children sleep and grow, sleep<br>
        and grow<br>
        and the sky is bluer<br>
        than it has ever been.<br><br>

  poem: What is happening to our hearts?<br><br>
        In our hearts?<br><br>
        We wake in the night to think of our loved ones.<br>
        We feel the enormity of our love  for each of our dearest.<br>
        We call. We forget what had appeared broken.<br>
        So too even unto ourselves.<br>
        Love reigns as she opens our eyes to the beauty in each of our beloveds.<br>
        And in ourselves.<br>
        As we know, when we encounter those we don’t even know, what we share:<br>
        A longing to touch. To connect.<br>
        Moments of thanks, and preparation, should we need it, for goodbyes.<br>
        As we slow, to enjoy preparing and eating.<br>
        As we plant, in our victory gardens,<br>
        little rows of hope.<br>
        As we see young fathers walking with their children.<br>
        At last.<br>
        How long we have waited to rediscover the simple.<br>
        To come home.<br>
        Seeing our homes and having time to dig deep into dusty corners,<br>
        To clean and polish,<br>
        Touch our homes with affection,<br>
        Until they gleam.

            Marking the Days

  poem: Perhaps I’ve marked each passing day in isolation<br>
        a pencil hashmark on a window sill.<br>
        Perhaps I’ve paced a line inside the chain-link fence<br>
        until the path is worn bald.<br>
        Perhaps I’ve fixed a meal of<br>
        potatoes again.<br>
        The hashmarks join the arrows<br>
        marking the sun at sunset<br>
        each solstice, each equinox.<br>
        The fence protects against the tumbleweeds<br>
        from the neighboring lot.<br>
        Maybe these changes are  recent, I don’t recall<br>
        but I’ve long been known<br>
        to love potatoes.

  poem: sit vacant in the gray<br>
        light of morning,<br>
        reminders of where<br>
        we sat yesterday,<br>
        our first visit in months.<br><br>
        This virus, armed with wedges<br>
        places an ironic twist on the adage<br>
        <i>Divided We Fall.<br>
        Now it’s Divided We Live,<br></i>
        so, no hugs<br><br>
        when we spotted you<br>
        on the street, despite<br>
        desire so strong it hurt.<br>
        Instead, laughs, tears<br>
        and the feeling I sit with<br><br>
        today, writing this poem:<br>
        a knowing that if we don’t survive,<br>
        instead become statistics,<br>
        that you loved us<br>
        as deeply as we loved you;<br><br>
        that these chairs outside,<br>
        weathering spring sun, rain and hail<br>
        are not vacant at all–  despite<br>
        all appearances, they cradle<br>
        invisible treasures<br><br>
        of cherished lives.

            Cutting Each Other’s Hair During the Corona Virus

  poem: We are two women who got married<br>
        seven years ago<br>
        but that is not our story of courage.<br>
        This story is about<br>
        sitting in the yard<br>
        in a plastic chair<br>
        an old towel around my shoulders,<br>
        clippers, scissors with teeth<br>
        on a side table<br>
        and my wife<br>
        with an anxious face<br>
        coming toward me<br>
        with sharp, small scissors.<br><br>
        If you think<br>
        we have no training for this job,<br>
        you are wrong.<br>
        We watched an old guy<br>
        with thinning hair<br>
        cut his own<br>
        on U Tube.<br><br>
        But now,<br>
        my wife lifts the clippers<br>
        to the back of my neck.<br>
        The goldfinches in the apple tree,<br>
        dapper in their bold spring plumage,<br>
        chirp encouragement.<br>
        Our dog watches<br>
        from the sidelines,<br>
        face filled with alarm.<br><br>
        The clippers buzz their way<br>
        along my neck,<br>
        then she grabs handfuls of hair<br>
        on top and lets the toothy scissors<br>
        munch on each clump.<br><br>
        When we switch, I let the clippers<br>
        linger and a bald spot<br>
        glares on the back of her head.<br><br>
        After,<br>
        when we look in the mirror<br>
        my formerly fluffy hair<br>
        is flat and the back of your head<br>
        is too close to bald,<br>
        but we glitter<br>
        smiles to each other<br>
        as if we just renewed our vows.

            Some Things I Really Like Right Now

  poem: "Guzzling cold water out of a bucket from the hand pump well.<br><br>
        Getting up in the morning and feeling the heat off the cook stove on my forehead.<br><br>
        Sipping the first two cups of coffee off the stove.<br><br>
        Walking around the house with the dog pack, smelling<br>
        Douglas fir smoke wreathing from the chimney.<br><br>
        Standing barefoot in our creek.<br><br>
        Smelling sagebrush crushed in my hands.<br><br>
        Smelling a burning smudge of sagebrush wafting through the house.<br><br>
        Watching clouds form up like spirits returning to the canyon above the house.<br><br>
        Listening to the whisper and sough of the fluttering aspen next to the window.<br><br>
        Following Chong’s suntanned legs up our creek.<br><br>
        Watching Chong nap on our hot granite bed in the afternoon.<br><br>
        Starting a new poem, finishing it, recrafting it again.<br><br>
        Sitting on a rock with a notebook and beginning a new sketch.<br><br>
        Enjoying that moment when the sketch says: “You’re finished.”<br><br>
        Sleeping in the grass with Wolfie and Luna the German Shepherds, and Dong-ee the Rottweiler.<br><br><br><br>
        Corresponding with Mike Robinson, creating new poems, learning from him as mentor and counselor, friend.<br><br>
        Laying out Okanogan Poems volume 4 on OneDrive with intrepid fellow steward and old friend, Okanogan poet, Walter Henze.<br><br>
        Emailing George and Patti Baumgardner about life, poetry, Earth, and the stars.<br><br>
        Talking with David, Hanna, and Sarah Kliegman about landscape restoration, homesteading, cooking, and trail and park making.<br><br>
        Emailing to Victoria Jones, Bob Goodwin, Carey Hunter, Walter Henze, George and Patti Baumgardner, Todd Thorn, Mary Koch, Dan Hulphers and Bobbie Hackett about their poems, about life and the real things that happen on the land.<br><br>
        Relearning the Español with my faithful neighbors and friends, Celso Pacheco-Pascacio and Carolina Ramos.<br><br>
        Eating never-the-same, so-called-routine breakfasts and dinners that Chong makes day after day.<br><br>
        Listening to Eagles concerts on YouTube with Chong.<br><br>
        These are some of the things I like right now."

        Listen to news. How many newly dead in the state? in the nation? in the world? Check CDC website for updates. On-line newspaper updates, Facebook updates. Send donations to Church and to Food Bank.<br><br>
        Since its Thursday, remember Zoom cocktail party with F & V at 5:30. Check level of gin.<br><br>
        Wash hands. Change from singing “Row Your Boat” to “Mary had a Little Lamb.”<br><br>
        Ignore the calendar. Don’t count the days.<br><br>
        Check school district website. Is there a change? If schools are open we want to be there. Research Kawasaki Disease.<br><br>
        Since its Thursday, put on gloves, mask, take car for its weekly drive. Don’t think about the olden days, when drives to restaurants or movies were every day easy.<br><br>
        Buy new hair trimmer; I’m sure it was the trimmer’s fault that J’s hair turned out that way.<br><br>
        Find flour. Buy some on Etsy? Email K for bread recipe. Search for Mother’s recipe. The scent of baking bread evokes stability, safety, security.<br><br>
        Since its Thursday, do Facebook post so the rest of the family knows we’re still alive.<br><br>
        Tell R about dream of trying to attend five different on-line funerals at once. I’m learning part of our love used to depend on our coming home to each other from different work worlds. Find some new reasons to enjoy each other.<br><br>
        Check with F. Can she Zoom babysit Sunday afternoon? R and I need some time together – alone as a couple.<br><br>
        Call bank. Check on options for partially paying the mortgage.<br><br>

  poem: “Quaint, cute,<br>
        lovely,<br>
        fun” by visitors<br>
        and passersby – the house<br>
        has<br>
        Lived and loved and embraced<br>
        and yelled and screamed in delight.<br>
        As well as anger with this family<br>
        for fifty odd years.<br><br>
        Kitchen redolent with smells divine.<br>
        Pungent, garlicky with pork,<br>
        fishy with brine and smoke.<br>
        Unbearably sweet with apples, cinnamon,<br>
        mango, honey so fresh the nectar<br>
        carries still the scent of bees and lavender.<br><br>
        The walls share space<br>
        shaped by hands over many years.<br>
        Spaces of men and gods,<br>
        promises of life;<br>
        of sky and stone<br>
        and earth warmed by sun<br>
        sheltered by those cedars<br>
        planted by the boys in childhood.<br>
        Bamboo and hedges of unknown<br>
        Provenance.<br>
        Caressed by life of azaleas petunias, banana,<br>
        tomato, squash, peppers, even lemon trees nurtured in pots<br>
        through challenging winters of sleet and snow.<br><br>
        In this space,<br>
        Squirrels daily race the dog to safety<br>
        In the cedar, knowing she never wins but<br>
        granting the thrill of chase to<br>
        breathe life to her dreams.<br>
        Jays and crows scold demanding food or something.<br>
        Robins and tiny sparrows<br>
        Break the night stillness<br>
        with sounds of enduring life, for that is the<br>
        order of things in the outdoor spaces.<br><br>
        Summertime sharing<br>
        rice and chicken and pork and shrimp<br>
        and Persian saffron, crimson with promise of sex and life.<br>
        Transformed into Spanish paella<br>
        fashioned with a hint of Ilocano and Ktunaxa<br>
        For good ethnic balance in this<br>
        household of voices singing<br>
        Family and family and family.<br><br>
        The walls -hung with paintings<br>
        Of children, women, flowers<br>
        Creations seeking<br>
        Eternal glimpses of<br>
        unbearable beauty<br>
        and life-<br>
        struggle vainly<br>
        to contain joy and<br>
        pain, love and passion within.<br><br>
        The weeping of agony and loss<br>
        Overcome always by the soft, smooth warmth<br>
        of your being, coaxing greater<br>
        Cries of passion and love<br>
        Escaping confines of this house.<br><br>
        The pandemic?<br>
        a small but significant footnote<br>
        forcing time to breathe, sleep, contemplate.<br>
        Long from now we will tell<br>
        Of the time of great fear,<br>
        Overwhelmed by the Greater Joy.
