  poem: Home structured in place<br>
        words from books with golden leaves<br>
        coverage of stories bless me<br>
        singly sitting in my cabin of flight<br>
        where I land, many galaxies at night<br>
        coverage of imagination blesses me<br>
        gardens of tenderness<br>
        green shoots with compost, the everlasting church of the garden<br>
        coverage of fresh growth blesses me<br>
        red flannel bedding cleanly washed<br>
        a glorious featherbed waiting to hold my body<br>
        coverage of nighttime dreams bless me<br>
        I am the boat in the water of my bathtub<br>
        a temple of sea-salts soaking<br>
        coverage of wellness blesses me<br>
        cooking in the kitchen<br>
        transformation served up on plates<br>
        coverage of nourishment blesses me<br>
        the gilded shelter unlocked<br>
        paying attention to my soul<br>
        coverage of “its nice to meet me,” blesses me.
