  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p class="sidebar">The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the economy, routines and pace of everyday life across the world. This project asks you to consider the poetics of your home and how its physical and emotional character is changing during this time. The home, whatever that may be for someone, is a space we each know intimately and can therefore represent poetically by sharing our memories, frustrations, daydreams, by describing its physical configuration.
<br><br>
Any poems, observations, mini-essays of home are encouraged. A simple image, a counter, window, shoe rack, emblematic of the writing would greatly enhance this effort at documenting our selves and spaces during this time. It is my hope that sharing of ourselves in this way will strengthen our bonds across Washington State and beyond.
